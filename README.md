## Make an impact - Adopt a bonobo 

I have always been greatly fascinated by our closest cousins - the bonobos. Not only do we share **98.7%** of our DNA, but even the social structures and behaviour can remind us of our own. 

The more you learn about them, the more you ask yourself: What makes us human? Why do we consider ourselves different from animals? The ability to learn another language? Bonobo Kanzi learned to communicate with 348 geometric symbols and understands about 3000 spoken English words. Surely not perfect, but still shows the ability to learn our language. Having sex for other reasons than reproduction? I think Bonobos are a step ahead of us there. Is it the use of tools and the ability to domesticate a fire? Well, check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMbWDRzqNhc). 

Sadly, their population is believed to have declined sharply in the last 30 years. They only live in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the years of civil unrest and poverty have made them vulnerable to habitat loss and hunting for bushmeat. 

The website has been created to increase awareness around the endangerment of Bonobos as well as raising funding for those working on the front line. Any visitor can inform himself about bonobos and their current situation, Bonodopt's program and contribute to support their work. While they live far away from us, it is still everybody's duty to look out for the vulnerable between us. I trust that this website is contributing in its own way and increasing the funds needed for their protection. 

While Bonodopt also takes donations, the main focus of the website lies in adopting a bonobo. This is to create a great first experience with the adoption kit and lay the path for further one-time or even monthly donations. Based on this, the website has been called Bonodopt, which is a neologism of bonobo and adopt.

## UX

### Goals

#### User

Bonodopt's website targets the following audience:
- English speaking
- Diverse *(gender, age, work, social status, nationality)*, but in private/ free time
- Want to make an impact/ a good deed
- Has a heart for animals *(possibly also a fan of bonobos)*

User goals: 
- Make an impact/good deed through donating towards a Nonprofit organization or charity of my choice.
- Read more about Bonobos and their current situation.
- *Possibly: Make an impactful gift*.

Bonodopt is specialized on bonobos and has, therefore, a niche position in the donation sector. Once the user settles on bonobos, Bonodopt's website offers the ability to donate and adopt a bonobo and therefore make a good deed by supporting a valuable project. It furthermore offers a broad overview over bonobos, their situation, Bonodopt as an organization as well as their project. Apart from that, an adoption kit can be sent as a gift if desired. 

#### Bonodopt

Bonodopt Goals: 
- Increase number of donations and adoptions as well as total monetary income
- Build an online presence and increase reach 
- Present Bondopt as an organization in a reputable and trustworthy way
- Long-term retention of users to ensure further or monthly contributions

During the development of this project, each point has been considered to ensure the fulfillment of Bonodopt's goals. 

To increase the funding, the website strives to provide a very positive user experience as well as an emotional response through high-quality images to make the user follow through with his intention to contribute to Bonodopt's project. Furthermore, there has been made a point of focusing the website on "Adopt a bonobo" instead of donations. It's a great middle way between the best- and worst-case scenarios of receiving a donation (e.g. 50 $ monthly contributions vs 10 $ one-time donation). Besides, it's expected to be more convincing as a call to action since it's only a one-time commitment with further value for the user through the adoption kit.
 
For an increased reach and online presence, the implementation of SEO has been crucial. Important factors were also the ease of use and a reliable layout to present Bonodopt in a trustworthy way and have a throughout positive user experience to convince the user to return to Bonodopt's website at a later moment. 


### User stories 


Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

### Design Choices

#### Layout

#### Colour scheme

#### Imagery

#### Typography

Raleway is a very clean and easy to read font, which gives the website an elegant touch. At the same time, it is not overly prominent, which allows the images to take a more intense effect on the user. The only exception is the "W", which looks very eye-catching and provides modern styling to the navbar and headings, where this letter is heavily used. It gives an additional layer of style that fits into Bonodopt's overall appearance. 

To ensure consistency throughout the page this has been selected as the only font.

#### Icons

Most icons were used to provide visualisation and structure of sections with much content like e.g. "6 Reasons Why Bonobos" and "What Do We Do?". Even though those sections are divided into several subsections, the icons help to further break it down and make it easier to take in. Furthermore, the icons help to reference this content when summarized (e.g. on the home page or on a small device). 
 
In the call to action section on the home page, I used icons to signalize that "Adopt a bonobo" and "Sponsor our work" are clickable links by changing their color when hovering. Since this is quite different from the usual links and buttons used throughout this website, it makes them stand out. As the main objective of Bonodopt is to raise funding, this is thought to increase the likelihood to get the user to the form and its submission. 

Icons were furthermore used in the footer to keep it visually clean and create space. This enabled me to provide the user with two different options to get in touch as well as links to 5 different social media accounts without overwhelming him with a busy footer. 


### Accessibility

The accessibility of websites is an important factor when planning and creating a project. To ensure accessibility, the following points have been implemented:

* **Navbar:** The active navbar element is not only visually emphasized through styling but also with a hint. The hint "(current)" has been added for screen readers only and, therefore, point out to the user, on which page he's currently on.
* **Images:** To ensure that any images provided give additional context to the user, the alt attribute has always been included with a short image description. 
* **Icons:** When using  icons it has been ensured that these are always hidden from screen readers. In cases where icons where not only used for decorative purposes but are needed to be able to use a certain feature or access a certain link, additional information is provided to screen readers only. 
* **Special components:** All special components, such as the collapse element for mobiles, include the necessary accessibility attributes to make sure that those are always easy to use.
* **Forms:** In cases where labels for form inputs were not wanted due to design choices, they were still added for screen readers only to ensure accessibility. Furthermore, the "*aria-describedby*" attribute has been added in cases where a hint would come after the related input field.  
* **Validation:** Custom validation styles were added as native browser defaults are not announced to screen readers.


### Wireframes

These wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwh472BRAGEiwAvHVfGsly1Nt9bDZCFUTGCc9I8OfaLtSIcxLhm_WX8911ERsm__luBJslTBoCqgQQAvD_BwE) during the design and planning process for this project. They have not been amended since the repository has been created and, therefore, display small differences when compared to the live website.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 

### Existing Features

- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:


### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea


## Technologies Used

### Languages
This project uses mainly **HTML5** and **CSS3**. Additionally, **JavaScript** and **jquery** from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) has been added to support certain Bootstrap components and its form validation.

### Libraries

- [Tiny PNG](https://tinypng.com/): Additionally compressed images for my project. 


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


## Deployment

### Deploy project

My project has been deployed to GitHub Pages. To do so, I completed the steps below:

1. Navigated to my repository "bonodopt"
2. Clicked on **Settings**
3. Under **GitHub Pages**, I used the **Source** drop-down menu and selected "master branch"
4. Clicked on **Save**

Once done, GitHub displayed the following message: " Your site is published at https://anabelalealcosta19.github.io/bonodopt/". I clicked on the link and could confirm that the website was successfully deployed. 

*Note: Use relative instead of absolute file paths to ensure that images are being displayed correctly.*

### Deployed vs development version

My Github Pages site is currently being built from the master brand. All changes have been saved, committed and pushed. Therefore, there should be no differences between the deployed and the development version.  

### Run code locally

To run code locally, the remote Github repository needs to be cloned. Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub has at that point, including every file and folder of the project. Changes can be pushed to the remote Github repository at any time.

Find below the necessary steps to be able to run the code locally. The default instructions relate to Windows, any differences for Mac and Linux have been added in brackets. 

#### Cloning a repository using the command line
1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
1. Under the repository name, click **Clone or download**.
1. **Clone with HTTPS**: Click on the clipboard symbol beside the web URL to clone the repository using HTTPS. To clone using a SSH key (or certificate issued by the SSH certificate authority), click **Use SSH** and then the clipboard symbol.
1. Open Git Bash [*Mac & Linux: Open Terminal*].
1. Change the current working directory to the location you want the cloned directory. 
1. Type **git clone** and paste the URL you copied in step 3.
1. Press enter to create the local clone.

### Acknowledgements

I got the inspiration for this project when reading "Bonobo Handshake" by Vanessa Woods. It was a perfect fit for my first Milestone project since it's a topic I'm passionate about and where I just refreshed my knowledge. Furthermore, it was simply a good fit for a static website since it doesn't necessarily require advanced programming to fulfill the user's needs and expectations. 

A special thanks to my mentor [Rahul Lakhanpal](https://github.com/rahulkp220), who has provided me with valuable insights into best practices when building a website and how to create a great UX. I furthermore want to thank the slack community of Code Institute for reviewing my project and providing me with constructive criticism. 

Last but not least, I would like to point to [Lola ya Bonobo](https://www.lolayabonobo.org/). When reading through their website, it becomes very soon clear that they do incredibly valuable work and put so much love into it. If one is considering making a donation, this is a project that I can highly recommend.
