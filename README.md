## Make an impact - Adopt a bonobo 

I have always been greatly fascinated by our closest cousins - the bonobos. Not only do we share **98.7%** of our DNA, but even the social structures and behaviour can remind us of our own. 

The more you learn about them, the more you ask yourself: What makes us human? Why do we consider ourselves different from animals? The ability to learn another language? Bonobo Kanzi learned to communicate with 348 geometric symbols and understands about 3000 spoken English words. Surely not perfect, but still shows the ability to learn our language. Having sex for other reasons than reproduction? I think Bonobos are a step ahead of us there. Is it the use of tools and the ability to domesticate a fire? Well, check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMbWDRzqNhc). 

Sadly, their population is believed to have declined sharply in the last 30 years. They only live in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the years of civil rest and poverty has made them vulnerable to habitat loss and hunting for bushmeat. 

The website has been created to increase awareness around the endangerement of Bonobos as well as raising funding for those working on the front line. Any visitor can inform himself about bonobos and their current situation, Bonodopt's program and contribute to support their work. While they live far away from us, it is still everybody's duty to look out for the vulnerable between us. I trust that this website is contributing in its own way and increasing the funds needed for their protection. 

While Bonodopt also takes donations, the main focus of the website lies on adopting a bonobo. This is to create a great first experience with the adoption kit and lay the path for further one-time or even monthly donations. Based on this, the website has been called Bonodopt, which is a neologism of bonobo and adopt.

## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
